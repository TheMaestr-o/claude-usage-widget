## Installation

### Download Pre-built Release

**Windows:**
1. Download the latest `Claude-Usage-Widget-{version}-win-Setup.exe` (installer) or `Claude-Usage-Widget-{version}-win-portable.exe` (no install needed) from [Releases](../../releases)
2. Run the installer or portable exe
3. Launch "Claude Usage Widget" from the Start Menu (installer) or directly (portable)
4. **To launch at Windows startup (portable only):** Press `Win+R`, type `shell:startup`, and copy the portable `.exe` into that folder. To update, copy the new version in and delete the old one.

**macOS:**
1. Download the latest `Claude-Usage-Widget-{version}-macOS-arm64.dmg` (Apple Silicon) or `Claude-Usage-Widget-{version}-macOS-x64.dmg` (Intel) from [Releases](../../releases)
2. Open the DMG and drag the app to your Applications folder
3. Launch "Claude Usage Widget" from Applications

> **Note:** The app is signed and notarized. If macOS still shows a warning on first launch, run:
> ```
> xattr -cr /Applications/Claude\ Usage\ Widget.app
> ```

**Linux:**
1. Download the latest `Claude-Usage-Widget-{version}-linux-x86_64.AppImage` (Intel/AMD) or `Claude-Usage-Widget-{version}-linux-arm64.AppImage` (ARM) from [Releases](../../releases)
2. Make it executable: `chmod +x Claude-Usage-Widget-*.AppImage`
3. Run it: `./Claude-Usage-Widget-*.AppImage`

> **Note:** AppImage runs without installation on most Linux distributions. On Ubuntu 22.04+, you may need to install a dependency first:
> ```bash
> sudo apt install libfuse2
> ```

#### Linux: Desktop Launcher & Autostart (optional)

By default the AppImage runs from wherever you put it. To get a clickable icon in your app launcher (and optionally launch at login), follow these steps.

**1. Place the AppImage somewhere permanent:**
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
mv Claude-Usage-Widget-*.AppImage ~/.local/bin/claude-usage-widget.AppImage
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/claude-usage-widget.AppImage
```

**2. Create a desktop entry:**
```bash
cat > ~/.local/share/applications/claude-usage-widget.desktop << EOF
[Desktop Entry]
Name=Claude Usage Widget
Comment=Monitor Claude.ai usage
Exec=$HOME/.local/bin/claude-usage-widget.AppImage --no-sandbox
Icon=$HOME/.local/bin/claude-usage-widget.AppImage
Terminal=false
Type=Application
Categories=Utility;
StartupNotify=true
EOF
```

> **Note:** The `--no-sandbox` flag is required for Electron-based AppImages on most Linux systems due to sandbox namespace restrictions. This is an Electron/Chrome limitation, not specific to this widget.

**3. Register the entry:**
```bash
update-desktop-database ~/.local/share/applications/
```

The widget should now appear in your application launcher. Test it by launching from your app menu before proceeding to autostart.

**4. Autostart at login (optional):**
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/autostart
cp ~/.local/share/applications/claude-usage-widget.desktop ~/.config/autostart/
```

## Usage

### First Launch

1. Launch the widget
2. Click "Login to Claude" when prompted
3. A browser window will open — log in to your Claude.ai account
4. The widget will automatically capture your session
5. Usage data will start displaying immediately

### Widget Controls

- **Drag** — Click and drag the title bar to move the widget
- **Refresh** — Click the refresh icon to update data immediately
- **Graph** — Click the graph icon to toggle usage history
- **Minimize** — Click the minus icon to tuck the widget away. By default it minimizes normally (the taskbar/tray icon stays visible as the way back in); with "Hide from taskbar" on, it hides fully to the system tray instead.
- **Close** — Click the X to close the app entirely (same as Alt+F4, or "Close window" from the taskbar icon's right-click menu)

### System Tray

Right-click the tray icon for: Show/Hide, Refresh, Re-login, Settings, Exit.

### Taskbar Icon (Windows)

Opt in via Settings → "Show taskbar stats" (off by default) to show session and weekly usage directly on the taskbar icon: split into left (session) and right (weekly) panels, colored by threshold the same way the tray icons and progress bars are, with a white X at 99–100%. Click the icon to toggle the main window, same as before. Requires "Hide from taskbar" to be off, since that setting removes the taskbar presence entirely in favor of tray-only mode.

### Scheduled session start (experimental)

In Settings, enable **Start session at**, choose a time and **Local** or **Cloud**,
then click **Save**. The default is **off**, with 06:00 as the start time.
The widget always uses Haiku 4.5 to send a tiny arithmetic prompt using your existing Claude login.
Saving does not send a prompt immediately. A time already passed schedules the next day.

- **Local:** requires the computer awake, online, and the widget running (including
  in the tray). It checks for an active five-hour window before sending. Existing
  windows and starts missed by more than five minutes are skipped. There is at most
  one attempt per local calendar day, even after restarts or time edits. An explicit
  HTTP 400 rejection can be re-armed by choosing a new future time and clicking Save.
  Failed or ambiguous requests are never retried automatically. Errors appear in Settings;
  hover over the info icon for requirements and scheduling details.
- **Cloud:** creates an Anthropic Routine with Haiku 4.5, a minimal cloud
  environment, no repositories or connectors, and a prompt asking it not to use tools. It runs while the widget
  and computer are off. Cloud requires Routines access on your Claude account;
  account verification or changes to the private API can prevent setup. Such errors
  remain visible in Settings. Routine creation and updates never call Run now.
- Cloud schedules use **UTC**, converted from the selected local time when saved.
  After changing timezone or a daylight-saving change, open Settings and click Save
  to resave the intended wall time. Execution may be a few minutes late. Unlike the
  local path, the cloud routine cannot check the widget's usage counter first, so it
  also sends its tiny prompt when a window is already active.
- Turning the feature off or switching to Local pauses the cloud routine first.
  This requires internet access; a failed pause does not enable local scheduling.
  Logging out or changing organization also pauses/disables the current schedule.
  **Closing or uninstalling the widget does not stop a cloud routine.** Use its
  **Manage cloud routine in Claude** link to pause or delete it independently.

The feature uses a small amount of your subscription allowance and does not increase
weekly limits. Neither a completion nor the configured start time guarantees an exact
reset time: the usage timestamp reported by Claude remains authoritative.

To test Local manually: choose a time about five minutes ahead, select Local, enable
the checkbox and click Save. Leave the widget and computer running. Inspect Settings
after that time. Test Cloud separately when no session window is active.

Offline scheduling/API-adapter checks (no real prompts or cloud mutations):
`node --test test/session-starter.test.js`

### Multi-Account Support (Advanced)

Launch with `--profile=<name>` to run a fully isolated instance — its own session, cookies, and settings — so you can track two Claude accounts side by side without them interfering.

Example: `claude-usage-widget --profile=work`

Profile names are sanitized to `[a-zA-Z0-9_-]` — anything else (including `.`) becomes `_`, so `--profile=jane.doe` resolves to the same profile as `--profile=jane_doe`. Worth knowing before assuming two different profile names you've typed are actually two different profiles.

This is a power-user feature, tested by us but not yet broadly validated by the community — if you hit issues, please open a GitHub Discussion.

### Recovering a Stuck Taskbar Icon (Windows, Advanced)

If a Windows taskbar icon gets stuck showing a stale or generic icon and won't update no matter what — even after a reboot — the cause is usually Windows Shell state cached against the app's identity (AppUserModelID), not a bug in the running app. `--reset-aumid` gives that identity a fresh, never-before-seen value without needing a new profile:

```
claude-usage-widget --reset-aumid                    # resets the default profile
claude-usage-widget --profile=work --reset-aumid      # resets a specific profile
```

This exits immediately after saving the new identity — it doesn't launch the app. Relaunch normally afterward for it to take effect. Any taskbar pin made before the reset will need to be re-pinned, since Windows ties pins to the identity that was active when you pinned them.

### Custom Login Domain Whitelist (Advanced)

The login window only navigates to a fixed, hardcoded set of trusted domains (`claude.ai`, `accounts.google.com`, `appleid.apple.com`, `login.microsoftonline.com`) — anything else is blocked, which is the correct default for security, but it means some enterprise SSO setups (WorkOS, Okta, custom SAML/OIDC identity providers, etc.) get blocked partway through login with a `[Security] Blocked login navigation to untrusted domain` message in the console.

If you hit this, you can add the specific domain your organization's SSO redirects through, without needing a code change or a new release:

```
claude-usage-widget --whitelist-add=api.workos.com     # exact domain only
claude-usage-widget --whitelist-add=*.workos.com        # domain and any subdomain
claude-usage-widget --whitelist-remove=api.workos.com
claude-usage-widget --whitelist-list
```

Each command exits immediately after running — none of them launch the app. Added domains take effect the next time a login window is opened, not for a window already on screen.

A few things worth knowing:
- **Global, not per-profile.** The whitelist is shared by every `--profile` instance on the machine — it's a one-time trust decision about a domain, not account-specific data, so you only need to add a given domain once regardless of how many profiles you run.
- **Additive only.** This can only add extra trusted domains on top of the hardcoded list — it has no way to remove or override `claude.ai` or the other built-in entries.
- **Wildcard syntax is exact:** a bare domain like `api.workos.com` matches *only* that exact hostname. Prefixing with `*.` (e.g. `*.workos.com`) also matches the bare domain itself plus any subdomain — use it if your SSO flow might redirect through more than one subdomain of the same provider, but keep in mind it's a broader grant of trust than the exact form.
- **Enterprise SSO can involve more than one hop.** WorkOS (and similar identity brokers) typically redirect once to the broker itself, then again to your organization's actual identity provider (Okta, Azure AD, Google Workspace, etc.) — a domain you control, not one Anthropic or the broker controls. If login still gets blocked after whitelisting the broker's domain, check the console for which domain got blocked next and add that one too.
- Multiple `--whitelist-add`/`--whitelist-remove` calls can be run one after another; `--whitelist-list` shows the always-trusted built-in list separately from your own additions.

## Understanding the Display

### Current Session & Weekly Limit

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Session Used | Progress bar showing usage from 0–100% |
| Elapsed | Circular timer showing how far through the window you are |
| Resets In | Countdown until the window resets |
| Resets At | Actual local clock time / date when the window resets |

**Color Coding:**
- 🟣 Purple: Normal usage (below warning threshold, default 75%)
- 🟠 Orange: High usage (above warning threshold)
- 🔴 Red: Critical usage (above danger threshold, default 90%)

---

## Privacy & Security

- Credentials stored **locally only** using encrypted storage
- No data sent to any third-party servers
- Only communicates with the official Claude.ai API
- Logout clears all session data, cookies, and Electron session storage

---

## Troubleshooting

**"Login Required" keeps appearing** — Session may have expired. Click "Login to Claude" to re-authenticate.

**Widget not updating** — Check internet connection, click refresh manually, or try re-logging in from the tray menu.

**Build errors** — Clean reinstall resolves most issues:
```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

If issues persist, open a [Support discussion](../../discussions/categories/support) with your OS, Node.js version, and full error output.
